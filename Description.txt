>>>The dataset consisted of 1376 images,
 690 face images with masks and 686 without masks.
 The original dataset is prepared by Prajna Bhandary and available at Github

>>Technology:-tensorflow,keras,openCV,CNN

>>>here,you will get Four python file 

1.Data preprocessing (change color data into gray scale,Reshape )

2.training python file (trained CNN model to detect mask in photo or video )

3.Detect Mask image(this python file will detect Mask in image)

4.Detect Mask video(this python file will detect Mask in video using openCV)

Note:-As Im still exploring (deep learning and OpenCV)So,I coundn't done many things to improve accuracy like (Increasing kernel ,Increase data volume using Augmentation,change Epochs,increase dropouts etc)
